# Netflix Movies & TV Shows - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
Netflix has become one of the largest entertainment platforms, offering thousands of movies and TV shows worldwide.  
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset from Kaggle to uncover trends related to genres, countries, release years, content ratings, and more.  

This analysis can help producers, marketers, and strategists make data-driven decisions about Netflix content distribution and audience targeting.
